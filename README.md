This project aims to develop an efficient and accurate dynamic sign language
recognition system to enhance communication between the hearing-impaired
and hearing populations. Utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, specif￾ically LSTM networks, and the MediaPipe Holistic framework, the system
will interpret dynamic sign language gestures in real-time, translating them
into corresponding Malayalam text. This initiative involves collecting and
processing a diverse dataset of Malayalam sign language gestures, training
an LSTM-based neural network to recognize sequential patterns, and imple￾menting a user-friendly real-time recognition tool. By providing immediate
and accurate translations, this system seeks to bridge the communication
gap and improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community in their
daily interactions.

• Literature Review
Conduct a thorough review of current sign language recognition sys￾tems, focusing on the techniques and technologies used. This includes
an analysis of the benefits and limitations of deep learning models, par￾ticularly LSTM networks, and frameworks such as MediaPipe Holistic.
The review will identify gaps in existing research and justify the choice
of methodologies for this project.

• Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect a diverse dataset of dynamic sign language gestures, repre￾senting a wide range of words and phrases. Data collection will be
performed under various conditions to ensure variability in lighting,
backgrounds, and signer characteristics. Preprocess the collected data
using MediaPipe Holistic to extract keypoints from each video frame.
This step ensures consistency and accuracy in gesture representation,
converting the video data into a format suitable for model training.

• Model Development

Design and implement an LSTM-based neural network model capable
of capturing the temporal dependencies and variations inherent in dynamic gestures. The model architecture will include multiple LSTM
layers followed by dense layers to improve recognition capability. Train
7 the model on the preprocessed dataset, using techniques such as early
stopping and learning rate adjustments to optimize for accuracy and
efficiency.

• Evaluation and Validation
Evaluate the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score to measure its performance. Validation will be
performed on a separate test dataset to ensure the model’s generalizability and robustness across different signers and conditions. This step
includes cross-validation to verify the model’s consistency and reliability.

• Real-Time Recognition Implementation
Develop a real-time recognition system by integrating the trained model
with a user-friendly interface. This system will process live video
streams to interpret dynamic sign language gestures in real-time. Ensuring low latency and high accuracy is crucial for practical application.
The interface will provide immediate feedback to users, making it suitable for various settings such as education, customer service, and daily
communication.
This methodology systematically develops and validates a dynamic sign language recognition system. It includes a comprehensive literature review,
data collection and preprocessing, and the creation of a robust LSTM-based
model. Evaluation and validation ensure reliability and generalizability, while
real-time implementation demonstrates practical use. Comparing our system
with existing solutions and documenting the process aims to enhance accessibility and communication for the hearing-impaired community.
